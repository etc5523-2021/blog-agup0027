# Introduction and motivation

Covid-19 has shaken the entire world. It has questioned the foundations of science, spirituality, humanity and all aspects of life on which we are currently surviving. It has taught us gratitude, acknowledgment, appreciation, love and care and most importantly how crucial health is. 

The world reaches a grim milestone as global deaths from COVID-19 surpass the 4 million mark. Compounded by fast moving variants and shocking inequity in vaccination, far too many countries in every region of the world are seeing sharp spikes in cases and hospitalization leading to an acute shortage of oxygen, treatments and driving a wave of death in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.

The present analysis has been conducted to highlight the situation of the disease in the countries of Pakistan and Colombia in 2020 and the measures taken by various stakeholders coupled with support from the community to abate the risk of catastrophic spread of the virus.
